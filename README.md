Ensure that the `screenshots` folder in your project directory contains both the full-sized images and their thumbnail versions with the new naming format (e.g., `thumbnail-home.png`, `thumbnail-products.png`, etc.). This setup will keep your README organized, with thumbnails linking to larger images for easy viewing.
